When I was freelancing as an Apple/tech blogger a couple years ago, I was writing a lot of iOS & OS X app reviews (in Russian). It was always interesting for me to learn in detail about Apple ecosystem and spread the word about all these awesome apps developers are building. 

One thought kept bugging me though, that simply talking about other people’s work is not something that I want to do forever. I knew I should try to build an app myself and the sooner I start working on that, the better. However, I didn’t have any serious programming experience back then and everyone was saying that learning iOS development straight off would be pretty hard. It seemed like black magic to me at the moment.

### Blogger in the streets, developer in the sheets

It was the Christmas eve of 2012 and I didn’t know what to do, so I’ve asked for advice some Polish guy named Radek who happened to be a young developer behind [Tadam](http://tadamapp.com) app (which I was reviewing back then) and who later [became](https://twitter.com/radexp/status/552221277986234368) one of my close friends. He was kind enough to describe his learning journey in detail and suggested me to do some “real world” Web programming using something like PHP and then learn iOS development. 

It’s not what I wanted to hear, so his advice was simply ignored. I’ve decided to dive in iOS anyway.

My main goal for 2013 was to build an iOS app and release it to the App Store by the end of the year. In January, I started reading The Big Nerd Ranch’s Objective-C guide book and watching Lynda.com’s courses on the programming language. After finishing that, I quickly moved to reading The Big Nerd Ranch’s iOS development book and watching CS193p Stanford courses via iTunes U. Wrapping my head around certain programming concepts was pretty frustrating sometimes, but eventually I just got used to that feeling.

I was learning iOS development almost every day, for a couple hours during the evenings, because I  was still working as a freelance blogger and attending high school. Five months later, I had a general idea on how to make fairly simple iOS apps, so I started thinking about my first real project. 

### Humble beginning

I wanted to make something simple, yet useful. My blogging experience helped me to step back and take look at the iOS app ecosystem as a whole, to understand what apps are currently missing. After some thinking, I came up with the idea of making an iOS version of “Special Characters” palette you have on your Mac.

It seemed like a reasonably easy thing to do and a quick App Store search revealed that all present apps in this category were not that good — they were either not updated for years or cluttered with ads or just ugly. Even though it’s a small niché utility, I thought there’re quite a few scientists, journalists, professors and other active iOS users who would find such a tool useful.

Without further ado, I’ve started developing the app in the end of April. The process was quite challenging at times, but with the help of [Sal](https://twitter.com/khanov/), Radek and awesome StackOverflow community, I’ve had a working version in two months or so. 

The app’s universal (iPhone & iPad) and had pretty basic features — you choose one of the categories, find the symbol you need and copy it to the clipboard, then simply paste it in another app. It also allowed you to switch to the so-called HTML mode and copy a Unicode representation of the symbol. Favorites and Recently Used symbols were there too.

I’ve submitted the app to the iTunes Connect in the beginning of summer. I felt pretty enthusiastic about it, imagining lots of downloads and great reviews on popular Apple-related blogs like MacStories. However, App Store review team thought it’s not “innovative and useful” enough, so it was rejected. And after resubmission and my appeal to change their mind, rejected again.

*Ouch!*

Now, I have to admit that was very disappointing. When you passionately work on something, you tend to attach a part of yourself to the project, making yourself vulnerable to the critique. That clearly was the case with my first iOS app.

### Rebirth

For the following month or so, I wasn’t sure about what to do next. While sending out my resume and trying to find a job as an iOS developer, I considered adding more features and refining the app. I also had the idea of starting a new project if everything else’d fail, but I didn’t have any great ideas at the time.

Eventually, I’ve landed a job at a startup called [Lapka](https://mylapka.com/) and I’ve ended up spending the second part of 2013 working on their iOS apps. Collaborating with other developers & designers was immensely useful for gaining lots of experience in such a short period of time.

Fast-foward to the January of 2014. During my winter break, I’ve had a couple weeks of spare time and I’ve decided to return back to the symbols app I’ve been working on last summer. 

Have you ever had that moment when you take a look at your old work and feel embarassed about how amateur and ugly it looks? There’s nothing wrong with that, quite the contrary, it’s an indicator of your growth as a professional. But you still feel ashamed for putting this out to the world, because [there’s a gap](https://vimeo.com/24715531) between your taste and your skill.

The first version of my app was terrible. It had a potential, but visual aesthetics and performance simply wasn’t on the level you’d expect from an iOS app. It didn’t deserve to be published on the App Store and was rightfully rejected by Apple. 

Armed with new knowledge and experience, I’ve refactored the code, redesigned the icon and screens, added new cool features (like iCloud sync) and removed redundant ones (like Unicode mode). The result was a lot better than the initial version.

That’s how [Symbols](http://symbols.khanov.com/) app was born, *finally*.

The reception was pretty humble. The app was reviewed on [Beautiful Pixels](http://beautifulpixels.com/iphone/symbols/) and a couple other Russian blogs. But hey, now I have my own app in the App Store and there’re actually people using it!

### Evolution

After fixing reported bugs and adding some missing characters in  version 1.0.1 soon after the release, I’ve again left Symbols for a few months. I knew there are other great features to add which would improve user experience notably, but I had to focus on my final exams and I’ve returned back to Lapka in the summer of 2014.

A lot of users asked me to add a search feature, because scrolling through a long list of symbols (even though categorized) takes too much time. However, this required to rewrite app structure with Core Data, since my initial implementation simply stored symbols in a plain array and it didn’t seem like the best solution for search.

On the other side, iOS 8 brought a lot of new awesome features, including custom keyboards which you can install and use in other apps. This meant that there’s no more need to switch between Symbols and the app you’re currently working in to paste some special character. Just like search feature, Symbols Keyboard would remove a lot of friction from the user experience.

Last September, I finally got back to work on Symbols. First, I’ve completed major refactoring and added Core Data with search feature. Then, inspired by the release of [Emoji++](http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/10/02/introducing-emoji-plus-plus/) app and pushed by Sal, I’ve shipped version 1.2 with Symbols Keyboard in late November.

With these two updates, the app got much more convinient and easy to use. You can now quickly find the symbol you need by its Unicode name. And the option of hiding certain categories from the Symbols Keyboard is a great example of a feature that didn’t took much time to implement, but makes experience a lot better.

### Lessons learned

In retrospective, I’d say that learning iOS development and building my first app was pretty challenging, but I really enjoyed the process of making the product that other people can use. Here are some of the things that I’ve learned along the way. 

**Give a damn about your customers**. When a user asks me for a feature, I always try to reply as quickly as possible. Even if I don’t agree with their point of view, I tend to explain in detail why I think their suggestion won’t take place any time soon. It’s naive to expect your users to care about your product if you don’t care about them.

**Experiment with the price**. I’ve found out that making the app free for a weekend creates a fresh wave of attention from the press and exposes the product to a lot of new people. By discounting your app, you may get tons of new users & reviews and there’s not much to loose anyway. Don’t do that too often though.

**App name is extremely important**. I wish someone’d told me that naming a project as generic as “Symbols” would mean it’d be literally impossible to find it in the App Store and Google. Moreover, the name was taken in iTunes Connect, so I came up with a really stupid idea of placing an infinity sign in front of the name: “∞ Symbols” (I’ve removed it in one of the later versions).


### What’s next for Symbols?

I will continue to support Symbols by all means and fix any major bugs if found. However, I don’t *actively* work on the app at the moment.

Of course, nothing is perfect and there’re things to improve and little bugs to fix. Generally speaking though, I believe that the app is stable and mature enough. And customers agree:
